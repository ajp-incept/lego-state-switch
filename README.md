# Lego State Switch

This project is a mockup for the Lego Case "Red, yellow, green", implementing one of the sample exercises:

> "An application showing the state (red/yellow/red) of one or more pieces of equipment"

## Description

This is the React JS mobile application mockup designed for workers to change the states of the equipment. The idea of the app is that it will interface seamlessly with a smartcard reader installed on mobile devices at each equipment. To change the state, please click on the “LOGIN WITH CARD” button, followed by the “Card” button in the modal. This will simulate a user logging in with a key card.
### Funtionalities:
Without login in, the screen shows the current states and queued orders.
Once the worker has scanned their ID card to login, the worker has the option of updating the equipment's state.
After updating the equipment’s state, the app automatically logs the employee out, leaving the device available for the next user.
